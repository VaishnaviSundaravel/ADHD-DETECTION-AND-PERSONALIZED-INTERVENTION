# 🧠 Explainable Machine Learning System for ADHD Detection

## 📌 Project Overview

This project presents an **Explainable Machine Learning (XML) framework** for the **early detection and subtype classification of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD)** in children using **clinical assessment data**.
Unlike EEG or neuroimaging-based systems, this solution relies on **structured behavioral and demographic data**, making it **cost-effective, accessible, and scalable**.

The system compares multiple machine learning models and integrates **SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations)** to provide transparent, feature-level interpretability, supporting clinical decision-making.

## 🎯 Objectives

* Detect **ADHD vs Non-ADHD**
* Classify ADHD subtypes:

  * Inattentive
  * Hyperactive
  * Combined
* Compare multiple ML models
* Provide **explainable predictions** using SHAP
* Build a **modular, reproducible Python pipeline**

---

## 🧩 System Architecture

**Modules included:**

1. Data Collection (CSV-based clinical data)
2. Data Preprocessing & Encoding
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training
5. Model Evaluation
6. Model Interpretability (SHAP)

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

* **Programming Language:** Python
* **Libraries & Frameworks:**

  * pandas, numpy
  * scikit-learn
  * xgboost
  * matplotlib
  * shap
* **Platform:** Google Colab / Local Python Environment

| Random Forest                | Ensemble learning                  |
| Support Vector Machine (SVM) | Margin-based classification        |
| XGBoost                      | Gradient boosting (Best performer) |

📌 **Best Model:** XGBoost
📈 **Accuracy Achieved:** ~92.5%

---

## 📊 Performance Summary

* XGBoost outperformed all other models
* Strong **precision, recall, and F1-score**
* Balanced performance across multiple ADHD classes
* Robust comparison using confusion matrix and classification reports

## 🔍 Explainability with SHAP

To address the *black-box problem*, SHAP is used to:

* Identify most influential features
* Explain individual predictions
* Visualize global feature importance
* Improve clinical interpretability
